# `Enmath`(`emat`) is an experimental full programming language styled as a math notation

The planned syntax would look something like this

```
f(x) = x ^ 2
k(x, y) = f(x * y)

Σ[0..10^2, i: f(i)] // sum of all f(i)'s where i is an integer from 0 to 100
```
I might also create an extension for VSCode for easier typing (so like replacing `sig` with the `Σ` sign)
